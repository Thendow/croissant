    <p class="main">
      A croissant is a flaky, buttery pastry known for its crescent shape and
      delicate layers. It is made from a laminated dough, which involves folding
      butter into dough multiple times to create thin, alternating layers of
      dough and butter. When baked, the croissant puffs up to a golden-brown
      color with a crisp, outer crust and a tender, airy interior. It is a
      classic French pastry that is often enjoyed on its own or filled with
      sweet or savory ingredients such as chocolate, almond paste, or ham and
      cheese.
